* Always plan out any new changes before implementing them. Give the specific changes to be made and a checkbox to track progress.
* After creating the plan, do NOT start the implementation. Ask for feedback and wait for approval for each item within each step that is required to be marked complete.
* Write the plan out to a markdown file in the `docs` directory.
* Follow production level coding standards and best practices.
* Use a test first approach (e.g. TDD) for infra, code and model related training, evaluation and deployment.
* When completing a task, edit the markdown file to reflect the status, marking the checkbox when complete. Do this inline.
