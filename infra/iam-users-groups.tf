# ML Edge Project - SSO-Only Configuration
# 
# This project uses AWS SSO (IAM Identity Center) for user management.
# All user access is managed through permission sets in sso-permission-sets.tf
# 
# No legacy IAM users or groups are created in this configuration.
# 
# For user onboarding, see: docs/sso-migration-guide.md
