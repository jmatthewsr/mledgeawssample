# Implementation Plan for ML Edge Project with AWS

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of an ML edge project that fine-tunes a small language model for intent classification using AWS services. **Following TDD approach and production-level standards.**

## Approval Process
üîí **IMPORTANT**: Each individual checkbox item throughout this plan requires explicit approval before implementation. No implementation should begin without specific approval for that item.

## Implementation Philosophy
- **Test-First Approach (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation
- **Production Standards**: Code quality, error handling, monitoring
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources defined in Terraform
- **CI/CD Ready**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Granular Approval**: Each item requires individual approval before implementation
