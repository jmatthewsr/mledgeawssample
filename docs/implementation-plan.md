# Implementation
### âœ… Pre-Phase 1: Project Foundation Setup - COMPLETED
- [x] Create comprehensive `.gitignore` file for Python/ML/AWS/Terraform project## ðŸ”„ Phase 1: Python Project Setup & Development Environment for ML Edge Project with AWS

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of an ML edge project that fine-tunes a small language model for intent classification using AWS services. **Following TDD approach and production-level standards.**

## Approval Process
ðŸ”’ **IMPORTANT**: Each individual checkbox item throughout this plan requires explicit approval before implementation. No implementation should begin without specific approval for that item.

## Implementation Philosophy
- **Test-First Approach (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation
- **Production Standards**: Code quality, error handling, monitoring
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources defined in Terraform
- **CI/CD Ready**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Granular Approval**: Each item requires individual approval before implementation

### ðŸ”’ NEXT APPROVAL REQUEST
**Ready for approval: Phase 1 - Python Project Setup & Development Environment**

Please approve the next item to continue implementation:
- [ ] **SEEKING APPROVAL**: Create `pyproject.toml` with modern Python project configuration

**This specific task involves:**
- Setting up modern Python project structure with pyproject.toml
- Configuring project metadata, dependencies, and build system
- Setting up tool configurations for Ruff, Pyright, pytest
- Defining project entry points and optional dependencies
- **Critical Foundation**: This enables all subsequent infrastructure testing

**Estimated effort:** 45 minutes
**Dependencies:** .gitignore (âœ… completed)
**Risk level:** Low
**Impact:** Enables infrastructure testing in Python (required for TDD approach)

**Please approve this single item before any implementation begins.**

## Technical Decisions (Updated):
- **Development Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Python Project Management**: Modern pyproject.toml with Poetry/setuptools
- **Code Quality**: Ruff for linting and formatting (replaces Black, isort, flake8)
- **Type Checking**: Pyright (Microsoft's fast type checker)
- **Development Scripts**: PowerShell scripts for Windows development workflow
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform with comprehensive testing
- **ML Framework**: SageMaker Pipelines with proper error handling
- **Model Format**: ONNX for edge deployment with validation
- **Edge Runtime**: AWS IoT Greengrass v2 with monitoring
- **Data Validation**: Great Expectations with automated testing

## Quality Gates:
- All code must have >90% test coverage

- All edge components must have integration tests
- Code must pass all linting and type checking

## Documentation Requirements:
- API documentation for all public functions
- Deployment runbooks for each environment
