# Implementation Plan for ML Edge Project with AWS

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of an ML edge project that fine-tunes a small language model for intent classification using AWS services. **Following TDD approach and production-level standards.**

## Approval Process
üîí **IMPORTANT**: Each individual checkbox item throughout this plan requires explicit approval before implementation. No implementation should begin without specific approval for that item.

## Implementation Philosophy
- **Test-First Approach (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation
- **Production Standards**: Code quality, error handling, monitoring
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources defined in Terraform
- **CI/CD Ready**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Granular Approval**: Each item requires individual approval before implementation

- Testing infrastructure not yet established
- CI/CD pipeline not configured

**Critical Dependencies:**
- `make.ps1` script is foundation for all subsequent development workflows

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Risk Level:** Medium (AWS infrastructure changes)
**Impact:** High (enables all subsequent ML pipeline development)

**Do you approve proceeding with Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup with TDD?**
